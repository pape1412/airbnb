Exploration of data from Airbnb.

### Data
The data set used in this project is publicly available at:

## Motivation
The initial motivation for this project came from my Data Scientist Nanodegree Program at Udacity. Becoming a great data scientist does not only mean learning how to build fancy machine learning models, but also how to communicate results. Whether it's an analysis you've made, a model you've built or a software you've programmed, your work will be useless unless the people you work with are able to understand what's going on.

In order to practice my communication skills I've decided to answer three questions around an Airbnb data set while using GitHub for end-to-end project documentation as well as a Medium blog post for presenting the results. As I am German I've decided to use data of Airbnb listings from Berlin. The three questions I was interested in were:
* How do Airbnb rates differ across different areas?
* How much money do Airbnb home owners earn?
* What factors influence Airbnb rates? Can we predict Airbnb rates?

## Files
The following files were used throughout the analysis of the data set:
- q1_airbnb_popularity.ipynb
- q2_airbnb_income.ipynb
- q3_airbnb_income_features.ipynb

Despite that, I've used a geojson file in order to create the choropleth maps of Berlin:
- berlin_neighbourhood_groups.geojson
There are two more geojson files of a neighbourhoods on a more granular level as well as one for ZIP codes.

I've created two maps:
- airbnb_income_neighbourhoods.html
- airbnb_prices_neighbourhoods.html
