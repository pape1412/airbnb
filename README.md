## Motivation
The initial motivation for this project came from my Data Scientist Nanodegree Program at Udacity. Becoming a great data scientist does not only mean learning how to build fancy machine learning models, but also how to communicate results. Whether it's an analysis you've made, a model you've built or a software you've programmed, your work will be useless unless the people you work with are able to understand what's going on.

In order to practice my communication skills I've decided to answer three questions around an Airbnb data set while using GitHub for end-to-end project documentation as well as a Medium blog post for presenting the results. As I am German I've decided to use data of Airbnb listings from Berlin. The three questions I was interested in were:
* How do Airbnb rates differ across different areas?
* How much money do Airbnb home owners earn?
* What factors influence Airbnb rates? Can we predict Airbnb rates?
